						<span>Why SAFER?</span>
						<p>
							We’re on a mission to help people discover the real value of travel — to inspire, to give more reasons, to make it easy — for you to go. Our company was founded back in 2005, and since then, we’ve imagined and created some of the most well-loved products for travelers all around the world.

							Today, Wego is used by millions of people every month — people who travel for adventure, for work, for family and for many other reasons. That’s why we work tirelessly to make your experience of planning & booking flights, hotels and trips as seamless as possible.

							Wego is more than just an app, a website or a company. Wego is an idea and belief that everyone has an innate desire and yearning to travel — to experience, to live and to grow.

							So ingrained is this idea of the human need to travel that we’ve woven this emotional and eternal question of “why we go?” into the name of our organisation — Wego.</p>

						<!--<span>Our mission</span> -->
						<p>We firmly believe that by helping people travel more, explore the world and experience diversity, we create a meaningful socio-economic impact.
						Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one’s lifetime.</p>
