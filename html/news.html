				<p class='description'>Dr. Yasmine Fouad, Minister of Environment, and Dr. Khaled Al-Anani, Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, held a meeting to discuss ways to support environmental and sustainable tourism outside the scope of natural reserves to promote the Egyptian environmental tourism product in the local and international markets.
					The Minister of Environment emphasized that tourism and the environment are two sides of the same coin and that we are all working together to develop the tourism sector to support the national economy, while preserving Egypt's wealth and natural resources and ensuring their sustainability for future generations.
					She stressed that the ministry is working hard to develop natural reserves in order to provide a distinctive environmental tourism experience, as the ministry is currently undertaking a campaign to maintain 90 beets in Sharm El Sheikh to ensure the comfort and safety of tourist boats during diving and snorkeling trips, in a manner that ensures the preservation and sustainability of natural resources.
