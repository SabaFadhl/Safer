					Dr. Yasmine Fouad, Minister of Environment, and Dr. Khaled Al-Anani, Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, held a meeting to discuss ways to support environmental and sustainable tourism outside the scope of natural reserves to promote the Egyptian environmental tourism product in the local and international markets.
					The Minister of Environment emphasized that tourism and the environment are two sides of the same coin and that we are all working together to develop the tourism sector to support the national economy, while preserving Egypt's wealth and natural resources and ensuring their sustainability for future generations.
					She stressed that the ministry is working hard to develop natural reserves in order to provide a distinctive environmental tourism experience, as the ministry is currently undertaking a campaign to maintain 90 beets in Sharm El Sheikh to ensure the comfort and safety of tourist boats during diving and snorkeling trips, in a manner that ensures the preservation and sustainability of natural resources.
					During the meeting, she clarified the means of activating the environmental management plan for marine tourism activities in order to support ecotourism and transform the environment into an opportunity for tourism investment, to develop the tributaries of ecotourism while controlling tourism activities to preserve our natural wealth.
					Fouad indicated that the Ministry of Environment, in cooperation with the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, launched last month the ECO Egypt campaign to promote nature reserves, and the programs it offers to support the tourism and hotel sector and its employees to raise awareness of methods of preserving natural resources while they work in a way that provides a unique environmental tourism product. In addition to promoting the reduction of single-use plastic bags and their replacement with environmentally friendly products.
					The two ministers reviewed the cooperation protocol to be signed between the two ministries for tourism development outside the reserves and arranging tourism investment operations in order to ensure the sustainability of the tourism industry, maximize the utilization of natural resources and promote the environmental tourism product, which was welcomed by the Minister of Tourism and Antiquities with his emphasis on the ministry's promotion of eco-tourism locally and internationally.
					For his part, Al-Anani praised the ministry’s programs for promoting eco-tourism and the efforts of the Minister of Environment to support the tourism sector by issuing decisions and policies regulating work during the Corona pandemic crisis, to stand by workers in the tourism sector in a manner that guarantees the protection of natural resources as one of the tourist destinations in Egypt.
					Al-Anani explained that joint campaigns will be organized to promote ecotourism as a unique tourism product within the plan to promote tourism in Egypt locally and internationally and through various exhibitions, in addition to producing a joint film to promote ecotourism and providing joint support to promote the environmental tourism product on social media and on the electronic platforms of the two ministries .
					The meeting also discussed ways to legalize the conditions of workers in the environmental tourism services sector in the formal sector in the next stage, in order to ensure the provision of safety and security standards for tourists and tourism service in Egypt.</p>
